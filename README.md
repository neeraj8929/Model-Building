# Model-Building

This project is focused on understanding mathematical model building from scratch. To understand the basics, simple mathematical models are discussed initially. The difficulty level of these models increases with each problem. Some of the concepts are based on the book Model Building in Mathematical Programming by Paul Williams. As the project progresses, more concepts and content will be added. 

**Model Building in Mathematical Programming** discusses the general principles of model building in mathematical programming and demonstrates how they can be applied by using several simplified but practical problems from widely different contexts. Suggested formulations and solutions are given together with some computational experience to provide the reader with a feel for the computational difficulty of solving that particular type of model. Furthermore, this book illustrates the scope and limitations of mathematical programming and shows how it can be applied to real situations. By emphasizing the importance of the building and interpreting of models rather than the solution process, the author attempts to fill a gap left by the many works that concentrate on the algorithmic side of the subject.
